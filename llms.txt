# Tario

> A low-level ASCII side-scrolling platformer game built entirely in C using ANSI escape codes for terminal rendering.

## What is Tario?

Tario is an educational platformer game that demonstrates low-level game development in C. It features complete physics simulation, advanced jump mechanics (coyote time, jump buffering), double-buffered rendering, and a scrolling camera system - all without external dependencies beyond the standard C library.

## Key Capabilities

- Complete platformer physics: gravity, velocity, friction, AABB collision detection
- Advanced jump mechanics: variable height, coyote time (0.15s), jump buffering (0.1s)
- 60 FPS game loop with frame-independent physics using delta time
- Double-buffered terminal rendering for flicker-free display
- Scrolling camera system with viewport culling

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jcaldwell-labs/tario.git
cd tario
make
./tario
```

## Common Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `make` | Build release version |
| `make debug` | Build with debug symbols |
| `make clean` | Remove build artifacts |
| `make run` | Build and run |
| `make test` | Run test suite |
| `valgrind --leak-check=full ./tario` | Check for memory leaks |

## Controls

- **A/Left Arrow**: Move left
- **D/Right Arrow**: Move right
- **W/Up Arrow/Space**: Jump
- **P**: Pause/Unpause
- **Q/ESC**: Quit

## Use Cases

1. **Learning low-level game development** - Study physics, game loops, and collision detection implementation in pure C
2. **Teaching game programming** - Demonstrate core concepts without engine overhead
3. **Terminal graphics techniques** - Learn double buffering, ANSI escape codes, and viewport management
4. **Extending the game** - Add levels, enemies, power-ups using the modular architecture

## Architecture Overview

The game uses a modular C architecture with separate components for game loop management (game.c), player physics and animation (player.c), tile-based level system (level.c), double-buffered rendering (render.c), and terminal control (terminal.c). Physics runs at 60 FPS with delta time for frame independence.
